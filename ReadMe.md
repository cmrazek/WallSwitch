# WallSwitch

WallSwitch is an application that automatically cycles your desktop wallpaper.

You can specify folders or RSS feeds from which images will be selected and displayed. You can choose to have images displayed in sequential or random order, with the possibility of separate images on each monitor.

For those with a multitude of random pictures that would like them to be displayed, there is collage mode. For each wallpaper cycle, a random image is selected and displayed on a random location on the screen, however, the previously displayed images are not erased, but are instead slowly faded to the background color in order to emphasize the newer images. For example:
